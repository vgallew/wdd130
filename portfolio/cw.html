            <h2>Eve Needed to Be Saved</h2>
            <img src="images/eve.jpg" alt="North By Northwest">

                In North by Northwest, Roger O. Thornhill is mistaken for a government agent who does not exist. While being pursued by Phillip Vandamm, an enemy spy, Roger meets the beautiful young Eve Kendall. Eve is the real government agent, the spy, the seductress, and the woman that Rodger falls in love with. Set in 1959, Eve’s role as a spy was quite unusual. The typical view of women was that they were to be housewives, mothers, and caregivers. That being said, women in the media were typically portrayed as damsels-in-distress or seductresses, who may or may not end up as the lady love to the main character. Eve encompasses all of these roles: the damsel, the seductress, and the love. It is a lot for one character to balance and, unfortunately, Eve does not do it well. Eve begins the film as a capable spy and then, as a result of poor writing, she is made to be incapable and incompentant, a damsel instead of a spy.

                When Eve is first introduced, it is clear that she will play the role of seductress. It can be seen in the way her eyes fall across Roger, as he seats himself opposite her; it is in the clean lines of her black dress, and her make-up which has been carefully contoured across every curve of her profile to give her the best advantage. This is a woman who knows what she wants and intends to get it. This becomes even more evident as she helps Roger evade the police. She maneuvers him right where she wants him to be and he stays there. Eve is even able to get Roger off the train and into safety with only a phone call and her personal charm to smooth the way. All this sets Eve up to be capable, confident, and courageous as she evades her foes.

                Eve saves Roger again by shooting him with blanks and letting Vandamm believe Roger is dead. After, Eve is able to escape, once again demonstrating that she is capable of evading the enemy on her own, and she meets Roger for a final farewell. It is at this point that Roger questions her, and all her setup as a capable woman is out the window. He tells her it is dangerous, that she should not go overseas with Vandamm, and this capable woman has no answer for him. Instead she runs. If their roles had been reversed and Roger was the spy, she would have been reassured and that would be the end of it. Roger would have gone on to complete his task and then come home safe and sound. Eve has shown, once on the train and once moments ago when she faked Roger's death, that she is capable—and Roger has the audacity to question her. Had Eve had reassured Roger with confidence, she would have maintained her credibility; but, as a result of poor character development she was reduced to nothing but a woman in distress.

                Eve’s degradation into distress is further reinforced in the final scenes of the film. Up to this point Eve has proven that she can make effective escape plans, she carries a weapon and knows how to use it, she is clever, and she is aware of the danger she has put herself in. When Roger comes to save her all of her character development disappears. Eve has no plan to get out, she has nothing to defend herself with, and no bright last minute ideas. She becomes nothing more than an object to be saved as Roger drags her through Mt. Rushmore. Given the prior setup for Eve this is unrealistic, her superiors have made it clear that she is trusted and on her own if she is caught. Eve herself has acted independently twice now to save Roger, but when it comes to saving herself she can do nothing. Hitchcock had every opportunity to make Eve even the slightest bit useful during these final moments. Instead, he chose to write Eve as an object to be saved and a prize to be won.

                Eve is a character with enormous potential. She was set up as an extremely capable woman, but she did not carry that potential with her throughout the film. As a result of poor writing Eve needed saving, even though every evidence said she should have been able to save herself. Instead of becoming an icon of womanhood, Eve became another damsel to be saved, another woman who needed a man to save her.

                I love the rain
                <br>
                The bright lightning 
                <br>
                The booming thunder...
            </p>
            <p>
                It terrified me when I was a child
                <br>
                The piercing cracks would shake the foundations of our hundred year old house
                <br>
                I imagined it would lift off its foundations and be cast into the wild of the storm
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, grown and far from that home
                <br>
                I throw open the windows 
                <br>
                Tucking close to the lash of rain against my open window
            </p>
            <p>
                I feel at Home
            </p>
            <p>
                I want to lay outside in the black earth
                <br>
                I want to sink into the petrichor and become one with that favorite smell of mine
                <br>
                I would hate the crawling insects but I welcome them with the rain
            </p>
            <p>
                Life brought me to the west
                <br>
                Where the rolling thunder stays barely a moment 
                <br>
                I miss it
                <br>
                Even in the face of majestic mountains and crystal rivers -
            </p>
            <p>
                I miss it
