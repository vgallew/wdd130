The Influence of Russia on French Romantic Ballet









Virginia Gallew
HUM 497R
Professor Charles Stratford
6th December 2021
When a layman is asked about the origins of modern ballet, one would almost undoubtedly answer France; while this is not exactly wrong, it is not precisely right either. It is true that ballet holds much of its origins in France, it is also true that France has been the epicenter of ballet for most of history; and yet, falsehood lies in the assumption that most innovations of ballet are French in origin. For example, take Tchaikovsky’s  The Nutcracker: the story is German, the technique (leaps and turns particularly) is Italian, the carriage of the body is French, and the music is Russian. Mapping the origins and characteristics for other ballets of the Romantic era would reveal similar diversity in their origins. While it would be fascinating to explore the interrelations between all of these countries' expressions of ballet, this paper focuses on the relationship between French and Russian ballet during the Romantic era in an effort to show why Russia is important to the broader context of ballet. As the epicenter of ballet moved to Russia, two things happened: ballet developed finer technique and it moved out from beneath opera. These reforms made ballet more accessible, and also gave ballet independence to grow as its own entity. By looking at this brief period in the history of ballet, one can gain a better understanding of the continual evolution of ballet and gain a greater appreciation for the art as it stands today. Russian ballet built on the foundation of French romantic ballet: giving ballet technical development and independence, without which ballet would have faded into the obscurity of opera, rather than thriving as its own art form. This essay will discuss French romantic ballet, how those ideas shaped the artistic innovations of the Russians, and how the Russians brought those ideas back to the West.
Ballet traces its origin to the Italian courts in the 1400s (O’Brien 20). They first took shape as court dances performed by couples in set patterns. Over time, these patterns developed and became increasingly complex. As a result, greater skill and training was required of each performer. The number of courtiers who danced diminished and men became the central figures on the dance floor. In particular, Louis XIV was well known as an exceptional dancer and, “In 1661 the Sun King founded the Academie Royale de Musique et de Danse, an initiative that established Paris as the centre of academic ballet, and this represented the early emergence of the complexity of ballet technique” (O’Brien 20). 
Ballet was well-loved in Paris, but it was rarely performed independently; instead, it was used primarily as an intermission between acts of an opera. These intermediate ballets were referred to as  divertissements  (Gutsche-Miller 75). They were typically short, spanning anywhere from a few minutes to just shy of an hour. Because of the shorter length of these performances, the audience might see between one and a dozen ballets during the intermission. It was likely an experience similar to seeing dance performed in competition, with each piece bearing its own story. Variations, like “The Dance of the Reed Pipes” in  The Nutcracker could also be considered a divertissement  within the larger narrative of the story, as it does not directly contribute to the plot of the ballet. Ballet was also performed in the background of the opera itself, with dancers acting much like extras in a film; they helped to provide background and atmosphere but were not vital to the performance.
Marie Taglioni is among the most important ballerinas in history. .. She was neither the greatest ballerina technically speaking, nor was she particularly good at    pantomime, which “combines dance and miming to create a narrative that can be followed by a common audience” (Gutsche-Miller 97). Taglioni’s greatest strength as a dancer was in her manner. The sense of lightness she was able to create even when the audience was aware of the difficulty of everything being done was and still is copied by ballerinas. It can be seen in the ethereal grace of the dying swan in Swan Lake and the sweet lightness of Clara in The Nutcracker as she explores the land of sweets. Taglioni is most easily recognized by her slightly rounded posture in the upper body, which creates the illusion that her body is longer than it is. In addition to establishing the expressive aesthetics of ballet, Taglioni also made  pointe a necessity for principal dancers  (Laemmli 1). Pointe refers to dancing while wearing shoes that are reinforced in the toe ( pointe shoes) allowing the dancer to rise to the tips of the toes or,  en pointe. In Taglioni’s time, these shoes were very similar to the soft shoe, made of canvas or leather, that was used in daily practice. “The sides of the shoe and the tips of the toe were darned in order to provide a modicum of support, but the essential form was unaltered” (Laemmli 8). The shoes themselves were unextraordinary, but the effect of raising the ballerina to the tips of her toes created an additional lightness that brought the fairytale characters of ballet to life for the audience.
Despite the genius of Marie Taglioni and other prolific ballerinas, ballet in Paris began to decline in the latter half of the nineteenth century. Many people saw ballet as an intrusion to opera and a threat to the development of other arts such as music, poetry, and theater (Sasportes 258). One critic noted, “The tiring uniformity of ballet inserted into the operas has long been an object of concern to all good critics” (Sasportes 260). There was some push back against these ideas by the Italians, who had long since separated ballet and opera acknowledging each as independent and edifying arts; however, since the Italian ballet masters were seeking recognition from the French their efforts were to little avail. By the late 1800s, many of the French ballet masters had moved to Russia. Among these were Charles Didelot, a Frenchman who is primarily responsible for the technical development of ballet in Russia, and Marius Pepita, best known as the choreographer for The Sleeping Beauty, and portions of The Nutcracker and Swan Lake. These ballets “which remain adored archetypes of classical ballet, continued to pay tribute to the Romantic tradition. This was the “golden age of classical ballerinas (Fisher, 2012, 52), who continued the image of gliding grace and feathery ethereality of the romantic ballet” (Clark XXII). Though the French lost sight of the value of ballet, Russians had already fallen in love with the art of ballet and so were ready to carry it forward.
Ballet was introduced to the Russian courts by Peter the Great in the early 1700s, and by the middle of the century, it was an expected skill for all members of the court (Levitt 122). The first ballet created in Russia was titled  The Sanctuary of Virtue. It premiered in 1759 marking the takeoff of ballet as an art in Russia. As previously mentioned, quite a few French ballet masters immigrated to Russia during this period. Some of these visitors did not just come to Russia by chance but were specifically invited for their renown. Among these was Enrico Cecchetti (O’Brien 28). Cecchetti is known by dancers for the Cecchetti style of ballet which emphasizes strength and power. As ballet in Russia developed, it borrowed techniques from Enrico Cecchetti and Christian Johansson—known for his delicacy in the French style of ballet—to form the unique Russian style of ballet that persists today (Guest).
Though ballet was no longer centered in France, many of the traditions from French romantic ballet continued in Russia: among these was the use of fairy tales, and rural settings. One of the more prevalent ballets that followed after this tradition is Tchaikovsky’s   Swan Lake. Though it is not confirmed,  Swan Lake was likely inspired by the German tale “The Stolen Veil” and the Russian “The White Duck”. The function of basing a ballet on a fairy tale like this is simple: fairy tales are common and well known. Thus, when a more common audience is faced with a new ballet they can follow the threads of the story even though the medium is different from what they are used to. The rural setting performs a similar function. For the lay audience, the scene of a lake deep in the forest is familiar, and for the higher class viewer, nature is romantic and magical.
Within Russian tradition, many ballets were also inspired by literature and poetry. Aleksandr Pushkin in particular was a highly respected Russian writer and poet. His writings inspired more than a dozen ballets (Pushkin Ballets). The most famous of these is   Onegin. This poem was so famous in Russia that, for a time, it was memorized in school (Royal Opera House). Though the ballet was not choreographed and arranged until 1965 for the Stuttgart ballet, it retains many elements of the Romantic period in which it was written. The music for  Onegin was, ironically, also composed during the Romantic period. About 1877 Tchaikovsky composed music for Onegin, but at the time it was an opera rather than a ballet. The music was later arranged by Kurt-Heinz Stolze, thus Onegin became Tchaikovsky’s unintentional fourth ballet.
In addition to shifts in narrative, many technical elements of ballet changed in Russia; one of the first things to change was the length of tutus. In Taglioni’s time tutus were long, with the hems resting below the knee, these are referred to now as romantic tutus. However, as time passed the skirts shortened to “reveal most of the leg” (O’Brien 30). From a fashion perspective the change in dress reflected the clothing worn by the women of the time, “a corset like bodice made of linen or cotton muslin which left the arms and upper chest revealed, cinched at the waist and lightly boned to emphasize the silhouette, accompanied by a multi layered bouffant skirt made of tarlatan or silk net” (O’Brien 31). Similar to the use of fairy tales, this made the fashion of dance more comparable, albeit significantly more revealing, with high fashion. From the dancer’s perspective, shorter skirts and less cumbersome sleeves allow for a greater range of movement and greater visibility of the body in order to showcase the technique.
Looking at technical developments, the shape of the upper body changed from Taglioni’s slightly rounded form to a more upright posture. This gives the dancer a greater ability to isolate the movements of the upper body from the lower body. What this means as far as viewing goes, is that the dance looks even more effortless because the upper body remains almost entirely unaffected by the difficult movements of the lower. Without these changes, Odile’s famous 32 consecutive turns would have been impossible as the more rounded posture does not allow the balance needed for so many turns. Taglioni’s rounded posture did not completely disappear from ballet; rather, it became something used during slower progressions. This allowed the aesthetic to live on, even as technique grew ever more difficult.
In addition to changes in posture and costuming, the literal shape, or spacing, of ballet changed as well. As anyone who has participated in the performing arts is well aware, one of the most technical aspects of performance is spacing, that is, positioning bodies on the stage in such a way that is both aesthetically pleasing and functional. This process can be simple on the part of the performers, but on the part of the choreographer, it is almost mathematical. In the words of Oleg Petrov and Tim Scholl, “The harmony of ballet [. . .] could not be ascribed to algebra, but to geometry” (46). This is especially seen in dances like “The Waltz of the Snowflakes” which is not particularly difficult choreographically, but geometrically it is arduous because it is formed in such a way as to remind the audience of the chaos and order of falling snow.
As ballet gained new techniques and leaned more towards the classical,  pointe work also changed. Taglioni’s darned slippers allowed her to rise for an instant onto the tips of her toes, but the structure of the shoes was not enough to allow any kind of sustained balance. As a consequence, early pointe techniques only allowed the dancer to remain on pointe for the barest moment, and extended balances, turns, and tricks all had to be performed  demi-pointe (meaning raising only to the ball of the foot). It is not exactly clear when and where  pointe shoes changed, what is clear is that “The platform, box, and shank—were in use as early as the late nineteenth century” (Laemmli 11). These additional structural elements in the shoe made sustained balancing, extended turns en pointe, and many other elements possible. It was also as a result of these changes that pointe became common for all female members of a dance company. It was also about this time that the shoes were manufactured by cobblers instead of being made by each individual dancer.
Russian influence gave ballet depth and the freedom to grow as an art form. In earlier years people looked to grow ballet by improving machines and suspension systems that allowed dancers to literally fly. After ballet came to Russia, the masters of ballet shifted their focus to the dancer. The stories developed, tutus shortened to show off the intricacies of the choreography, and pointe shoes gained a more supportive structure. Ballet in Russia grew, and with the turn of the century, the West was able to experience that growth through the Ballet Russes.
The Ballet Russes was founded in 1909 in Paris and the epicenter of ballet returned to France. The idea that the entirety of ballet moved from Russia to France with the creation of a single dance company seems, at first glance, to be utterly absurd. However, Ballet Russes was able to accomplish something that no other dance patron or company could: they separated ballet from opera and gave it equal standing with the other arts. In her article exploring the artistic impact of the Ballet Russes Seda Ayvazoğlu states:
“The Ballets Russes of Sergei Diaghilev claims a special position, even a unique one, in the history of the performing arts, in terms of a reawakening of interest in ballet in Europe and America, in bringing Russian culture to the attention of the rest of the Western world, and in presenting ballet as an equal partnership of movement, music, and visual design, in which all of the creative participants -composers, designers, and choreographers, as well as the inventors of plots and authors of scenarios- exerted an influence upon other aspects of their collaborative works. While this was an enterprise that appealed especially to privileged and cultured populations in the largest cities, it exerted an influence on the future of ballet that extended far beyond those cities and endured beyond the impressive immediate accomplishment of having presented some seventy individual ballets that were created and performed through the collaboration of many of the significant artists of the early years of the twentieth century” (145). 

The truly remarkable thing about the Ballet Russes is that it did not place ballet above other arts, it placed ballet on equal ground. No longer was ballet made out to be a competitor for opera, music, literature, fashion, or painting, instead, it became a conglomeration of all of these as well as an art in its own standing.
Because of the attention and technical developments Russia gave the art of ballet, it was able to thrive during the latter part of the nineteenth century. Upon the ballet’s return to France, it was evolved, it had grown out from beneath the shadow of opera and the critics who would have seen it fade into obscurity. Ballet is an art that is often overlooked, especially in the study of art, yet it endures, in no small part due to Russian influence. George Borodin said, “The simple fact, which has nothing to do with aesthetics, is that dancing is the natural emotional expression of slavs in general and Russians in particular” (xiii). When ballet came to Russia, they grasped it in a way that allowed it to develop technique with the help and influence of many individuals of varying backgrounds; further, they allowed music, narrative, art, and fashion to be just as important to ballet as the dance itself. By looking at the influence Russia had on ballet in the late nineteenth-century one can see how much ballet grew and how that growth shaped ballet as it is known today. In further research on the topic, one might explore Russian influence on the modern conception of ballet, looking at persons such as Anna Pavlova, George Balanchine, and Mikhail Baryshnikov. Alternatively, one could spend years researching the Ballet Russes, Sergei Diaghilev, and Vaslav Nijinsky whose work is so wildly different from anything that came before or after that it is a quandary as to where their inspiration came from. Ballet is an art, one deserving of time, attention, and care. For the audience it is a wonderful spectacle, capable of creating scenes of romance and beauty beyond compare; and for the dancer, it is a means of expression, one that is able to share what cannot be otherwise conveyed.

        Eve Needed to be Saved
           In North by Northwest, Roger O. Thornhill is mistaken for a government agent who does not exist. While being pursued by Phillip Vandamm, an enemy spy, Roger meets the beautiful young Eve Kendall. Eve is the real government agent, the spy, the seductress, and the woman that Rodger falls in love with. Set in 1959, Eve’s role as a spy was quite unusual. The typical view of women was that they were to be housewives, mothers, and caregivers. That being said, women in the media were typically portrayed as damsels-in-distress or seductresses, who may or may not end up as the lady love to the main character. Eve encompasses all of these roles: the damsel, the seductress, and the love. It is a lot for one character to balance and, unfortunately, Eve does not do it well. Eve begins the film as a capable spy and then, as a result of poor writing, she is made to be incapable and incompentant, a damsel instead of a spy.
          When Eve is first introduced, it is clear that she will play the role of seductress. It can be seen in the way her eyes fall across Roger, as he seats himself opposite her; it is in the clean lines of her black dress, and her make-up which has been carefully contoured across every curve of her profile to give her the best advantage. This is a woman who knows what she wants and intends to get it. This becomes even more evident as she helps Roger evade the police. She maneuvers him right where she wants him to be and he stays there. Eve is even able to get Roger off the train and into safety with only a phone call and her personal charm to smooth the way. All this sets Eve up to be capable, confident, and courageous as she evades her foes.
          Eve saves Roger again by shooting him with blanks and letting Vandamm believe Roger is dead. After, Eve is able to escape, once again demonstrating that she is capable of evading the enemy on her own, and she meets Roger for a final farewell. It is at this point that Roger questions her, and all her setup as a capable woman is out the window. He tells her it is dangerous, that she should not go overseas with Vandamm, and this capable woman has no answer for him. Instead she runs. If their roles had been reversed and Roger was the spy, she would have been reassured and that would be the end of it. Roger would have gone on to complete his task and then come home safe and sound. Eve has shown, once on the train and once moments ago when she faked Roger's death, that she is capable—and Roger has the audacity to question her. Had Eve had reassured Roger with confidence, she would have maintained her credibility; but, as a result of poor character development she was reduced to nothing but a woman in distress.
          Eve’s degradation into distress is further reinforced in the final scenes of the film. Up to this point Eve has proven that she can make effective escape plans, she carries a weapon and knows how to use it, she is clever, and she is aware of the danger she has put herself in. When Roger comes to save her all of her character development disappears. Eve has no plan to get out, she has nothing to defend herself with, and no bright last minute ideas. She becomes nothing more than an object to be saved as Roger drags her through Mt. Rushmore. Given the prior setup for Eve this is unrealistic, her superiors have made it clear that she is trusted and on her own if she is caught. Eve herself has acted independently twice now to save Roger, but when it comes to saving herself she can do nothing. Hitchcock had every opportunity to make Eve even the slightest bit useful during these final moments. Instead, he chose to write Eve as an object to be saved and a prize to be won.
          Eve is a character with enormous potential. She was set up as an extremely capable woman, but she did not carry that potential with her throughout the film. As a result of poor writing Eve needed saving, even though every evidence said she should have been able to save herself. Instead of becoming an icon of womanhood, Eve became another damsel to be saved, another woman who needed a man to save her.

        the rain
I love the rain
The bright lightning 
The booming thunder...

It terrified me when I was a child
The piercing cracks would shake the foundations of our hundred year old house
I imagined it would lift off its foundations and be cast into the wild of the storm

Now, grown and far from that home
I throw open the windows 
Tucking close to the lash of rain against my open window

I feel at Home

I want to lay outside in the black earth
I want to sink into the petrichor and become one with that favorite smell of mine
I would hate the crawling insects but I welcome them with the rain

Life brought me to the west
Where the rolling thunder stays barely a moment 
I miss it
Even in the face of majestic mountains and crystal rivers -

I miss it
