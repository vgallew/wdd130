    <h2>Virginia Gallew</h2>
    <p>Hello! I am studying Humanities with an emphasis in business. I absolutely love my degree and I look forward to graduating at the end of this year. I am also looking to attend graduate school - crazy I know - after taking a gap year.</p>
    <p>I decided to take this class to help me become more techlogically literate and to curate future career opportunites. So far I have really enjoyed learning about HTML and CSS, it pleases the parts of my brain that want everything to be organized.
    </p>
    <p>Outside of studying and my TA job, I love to read, play video games, dance, listen to music, and spend time with my friends.</p>
